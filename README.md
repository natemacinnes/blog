[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7c6d7736-bc1e-4e5e-9711-f4f69734e4c2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/unruffled-feynman-ab340e/deploys)

Next.js / Netlify CMS blog based on the template by ![wutali](https://github.com/wutali).

## Dependencies

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

## Customization

This template is just a template and a boilerplate in which users can customize anything after the project was cloned and started.
The following instructions introduce common customization points like adding new metadata or applying a new design theme.

### Styling pages by a customized theme

All source codes related to the blog are under [components](/src/components), [pages](/src/pages), and
[layouts](/src/layouts) directory.
You can modify it freely if you want to apply your design theme.
All components use [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) and [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) to define their styles, but you can choose any styling libraries for designing your theme.

The directory tree containing the blog source code are described below:

```
meta: yaml files defining metadata like authors or tags
public: images, favicons and other static assets
src
├── assets: other assets using inside of components
├── components: pieces of components consisting of pages
├── layouts: layout components for each post page
├── lib: project libraries like data fetching or pagination
└── pages: page components managing by Next.js
```

### Organizing content by categories

The category metadata that associates with content have the same relationship with the authors' one.
Then reference these implementations for adding new metadata:

- [public/admin/config.yml](/public/admin/config.yml#L51): author metadata definition for Netlify CMS
- [src/lib/authors.tsx](/src/lib/authors.ts): fetches metadata and defines utility functions for components
- [meta/authors.yml](/src/meta/authors.yml): author content managed by Netlify CMS
- [layouts/index.tsx](/src/layouts/index.tsx): displays author content for each page

You understood they have four steps to add the category metadata on your project after you read the above source codes:

1. Define the category metadata on the above Netlify config file
2. Create an empty file named with `categories.yml` under [meta](/src/meta/) directory
3. Create a new module for fetching category metadata
4. Display the category metadata on [layouts](/src/layouts/index.tsx#L71) or other components you want

It is all you have to do. After that, you can access Netlify CMS and create new categories at any time.

### Locale settings for Netlify CMS

Modify [config.yml](/public/admin/config.yml) and
[index.html](/public/admin/index.html) under [public/admin](/public/admin/) directory
